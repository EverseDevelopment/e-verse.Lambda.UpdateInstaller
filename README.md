<br/>




## Getting Started
This is a C# code, you can just run it locally, just make sure you have the followin environment variables:

"AWSKey": The Key of an IAM user with access to S3
"AWSSecret": The Secret of an IAM user with access to S3 
"region": The region where the S3 will be located

Also when deploying from Visual studio to AWS Lambda make sure to add a file named "aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json" inside the InstallerAutoUpdate folder with the following data:

```json
{
    "Information" : [
        "This file provides default values for the deployment wizard inside Visual Studio and the AWS Lambda commands added to the .NET Core CLI.",
        "To learn more about the Lambda commands with the .NET Core CLI execute the following command at the command line in the project root directory.",
        "dotnet lambda help",
        "All the command line options for the Lambda command can be specified in this file."
    ],
    "profile"     : "",
    "region"      : "",
    "configuration" : "",
    "function-runtime" : "",
    "function-memory-size" : ,
    "function-timeout"     : ,
    "function-handler"     : "",
    "framework"            : "",
